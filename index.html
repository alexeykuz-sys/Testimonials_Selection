              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel
              i got every penny's worth.

              "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
              and found it incredible fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The
              next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling -time of my life.
              Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,
              working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

              "Before joining bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
              needed some structure from professionals who can help programming
              step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former studend of
              theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
              entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
              hands-on and i never had to wait for a long assistance. The agile
              team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
              to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
              fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of
              my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as sa
              full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
              recommend! "
