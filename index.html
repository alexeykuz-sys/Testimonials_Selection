              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel
              i got every penny's worth.

              "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've
              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
              and found it incredible fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The
              next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling -time of my life.
              Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,
              working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."
